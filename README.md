ScoobieCipher takes text that the user enters and asks the Scoobie Boy, helplessly trapped inside of the program, to masterfully translate the user's message into rhythmic nonsense, also known as ScoobieSpeak. In all sincerity, ScoobieCipher is one layer of implemented RSA encryption (which explains Scoobie Boy's verboseness) with a nice wrapping that includes translating the bytes to ScoobieSpeak, and when appropriate translating the ScoobieSpeak back to bytes for decryption. It includes my first true experimentation with Java's GUI, and my first implementation of anything near the border of serious cryptography.

This program is shamelessly based off of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy8kmNEo1i8"> Scatman John </a>. I drew Scoobie Boy using Photoshop CS6.
